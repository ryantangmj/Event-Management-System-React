## About The Project

Event Genesis is an innovative event management platform designed to simplify the way users organize and participate in events. This platform supports users in taking on both roles - as an organiser and a participant, providing a suite of tools to search, register, and manage events effectively and efficiently.

## Technology Stack

- **JSF (JavaServer Faces):** A Java specification for building component-based user interfaces for web applications.
- **PrimeFaces:** An open-source UI framework for JSF that provides over 100 components for web application development.
- **Java EE (Java Platform, Enterprise Edition):** A standard platform for developing multi-tier enterprise applications.
- **CSS:** For styling and improving the user interface.
